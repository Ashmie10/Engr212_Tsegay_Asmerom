Durkio told me he been on some positive shit, yeah, yeah
Lately, I just wanna show up and body some shit, yeah, yeah
Always been a lil' mathematician, lately it's cash I'm gettin'
Got me losin' count of these bags, I've been movin' too fast
Hard times don't last, 'member when cops harrassed
Talkin' out my ass, boy, you ain't shit but a bitch with a badge
All my life (all my life)
They been tryin' to keep me down (they been tryin' to keep me down)
All this time (all this time)
They couldn't break me, they couldn't break me (no, no)
They couldn't take me, they couldn't take me (no)
All my life (all my life)
They been tryin' to keep me down (they been tryin' to keep me down)
I decided I had to finish, but the media called me a menace
I done sat with the mayor and politicians, I'm tryna change up the image
You can't blame my past no more, I come from the trenches
Some said I'd never be a superstar, but I know I'm different (no, no, no)
I'm The Voice, but the system ain't give me a choice
Know some people that's still on deploy
I know a felon who tryna get FOID
Always been a lil' mathematician, lately it's cash I'm gettin'

Child support your only support
For a visit, I'm goin' through courts
Went to jail, they was chainin' me up
And you know that I'm famous as fuck
See how you gon' joke about stimulus?
But they really had came in the clutch
I know some kids wanna hurt they self
Stop tryna take drugs, I refer to myself
Tryna better myself, tryna better my health but
All my life (all my life)

First-generation ghetto nigga
Cole world, hello niggas
Made it out the city with my head on straight
Niggas keep shootin' up the lead out
Young Jordan Peele, gotta get out
'Cause the shit that I spit out
Is a cheat code like I'm facin' a RICO, how a nigga put a hit out
And another one, and, and another one
I got like a hundred of 'em
'Bout to lap niggas so they think they ahead of me, but I'm really in front of them
Now some of them fumblin' they bags
Fuckin' up the little crumbs that they had
A reminder to humble yourself, this shit could be gone in an instant
Me, I'm runnin' long distance
All pistons firin'
I be stuck between maybe retirin'
And feelin' like I'm just not hittin' my prime
These days scene rappers be dyin'
Way before they even gettin' they shine
I never even heard of lil' buddy
'Til somebody murdered lil' buddy
Now I'm on the phone, searchin' lil' buddy name
Got to playin' his tunes, all day in my room
Thinkin', "Damn, this shit wicked, to get they names buzzin'
Some niggas just gotta go lay in a tomb"
And media thirsty for clicks, I got a new rule
If you ain't never posted a rapper when he was alive
You can't post about him after he get hit
